1. PURPOSE OF THIS WORK

Our project ultimately will have a larger scope to include making more FDA SPLs computable. For now, however, the example of remdesivir is available as as group of files listed above.

Here is more specific detail about each file, its contents and uses. In particular, for the remdesivir SPL content in a Knowledge Object, instructions for using the object are given here. In some cases, links to other technical documentation from the Knowledge Grid team are used.
