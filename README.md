THIS COLLECTION OF FILES CORREPSONDS TO THE PAPER UNDER REVIEW TITLED, "An Experiment to Convert Structured Product Labels to Computable Prescribing Information"

The files and work described in the paper are available for inspection and review here, including:

1. A copy of the October 2020 Remedesivir Label with its Prescribing Information in PDF format

3. An Excel file with content from the Remdesivir OCT 2020 Label organized into 86 question-and-answer pairs (QApairs)

4. A file with a JSON data object combining the 86 QA pairs
5. A folder with a working Knowledge Grid Knowlege Object containing the following files
      a. a SRC folder containing an index.js file with a working JavaScript function 
      b. a Deployment Description file
      c. a Service Description file in Open API 3.0 YAML format
      d. a Knowledge Object metadata file
6. A Postman requests file for engaging the API backed by the remdesivir SPL Knowledge Object

  
Our project ultimately will have a larger scope to include making more FDA SPLs computable. For now, however, the example of remdesivir is available as as group of files listed above.

Here is more specific detail about each file, its contents and uses. In particular, for the remdesivir SPL content in a Knowledge Object, instructions for using the object are given here. In some cases, links to other technical documentation from the Knowledge Grid team are used.
