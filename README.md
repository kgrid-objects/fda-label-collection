# fda-label-collection


January 2021

This new collection of Knowledge Objects explores how to represent the content of FDA Structured Product Labels in different ways that allow for more granular information retrieval.

The first move to build this collection focuses on the anti-viral drug remdesivir. The remdesivir label Knowledge Object is an attempt to use a question-answer approach to re-organizing and structuring remdesivir FDA label content in a large JSON object. The KO allows that large JSON object to be interrogated via an API described in its service description. 

What we learn from the remdesivir label KO will be applied to future explorations along these lines. 

The content of the remdesivir label is broken down and analyzed here:
