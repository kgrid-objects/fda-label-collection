Transaminase elevations have also been reported in patients with COVID-19 who received VEKLURY. Because transaminase elevations have been reported as a clinical feature of COVID-19, including in patients receiving placebo in clinical trials of VEKLURY, and the incidence was similar in patients receiving placebo versus VEKLURY in clinical trials of VEKLURY, discerning the contribution of VEKLURY to transaminase elevations in patients with COVID-19 can be challenging.",

Subjects treated with VEKLURY received 200 mg on Day 1 and 100 mg once daily on subsequent days.

Remdesivir is an adenosine nucleotide prodrug that distributes into cells where it is metabolized to a nucleoside monophosphate intermediate by carboxyesterase 1 and/or cathepsin A, depending upon the cell type. The nucleoside monophosphate is subsequently phosphorylated by cellular kinases to form the pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate metabolite (GS-443902). Remdesivir triphosphate (RDV TP) acts as an analog of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and competes with high selectivity (3.65-fold) over the natural ATP substrate for incorporation into nascent RNA chains by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which results in delayed chain termination (position i+3) during replication of the viral RNA. In a biochemical assay assessing RDV-TP incorporation by the MERS-CoV RdRp complex, RDV-TP inhibited RNA synthesis with an IC\n         \n \n  \n value of 0.032 ÂµM. RDV-TP can also inhibit viral RNA synthesis following its incorporation into the template viral RNA as a result of read-through by the viral polymerase that may occur at higher nucleotide concentrations. When remdesivir nucleotide is present in the viral RNA template, the efficiency of incorporation of the complementary natural nucleotide is compromised, thereby inhibiting viral RNA synthesis. Remdesivir triphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA and RNA polymerases, including human mitochondrial RNA polymerase."
