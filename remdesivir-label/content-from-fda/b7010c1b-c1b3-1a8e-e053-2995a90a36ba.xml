Signs and symptoms may include hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypoxia, fever, dyspnea, wheezing, angioedema, rash, nausea, diaphoresis, and shivering. Slower infusion rates, with a maximum infusion time of up to 120 minutes, can be considered to potentially prevent these signs and symptoms. Monitor patients under close medical supervision for hypersensitivity reactions during and following administration of VEKLURY. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occur, immediately discontinue administration of VEKLURY and initiate appropriate treatment. The use of VEKLURY is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to VEKLURY or any components of the product

Transaminase elevations have also been reported in patients with COVID-19 who received VEKLURY. Because transaminase elevations have been reported as a clinical feature of COVID-19, and the incidence was similar in patients receiving placebo versus VEKLURY in clinical trials of VEKLURY, discerning the contribution of VEKLURY to transaminase elevations in patients with COVID-19 can be challenging

                  <paragraph>The Secretary of HHS has declared that circumstances exist that justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, the FDA has issued an EUA for the approved product, VEKLURY, for the unapproved use to treat hospitalized pediatric patients weighing 3.5 kg to less than 40 kg

  <footnote ID="K1794">The healthcare provider should visit clinicaltrials.gov to determine whether there is an active clinical trial for the product in this disease/condition and whether enrollment of the patient(s) in a clinical trial is more appropriate than product use under this EUA.</footnote>. FDA has issued this EUA, requested by Gilead Sciences, Inc. and based on their submitted data. As a healthcare provider, you must comply with the mandatory requirements of the EUA (see above).
      

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Although limited scientific information is available in the pediatric population, based on the totality of the scientific evidence available to date, it is reasonable to believe that VEKLURY may be effective for the treatment of COVID-19 in pediatric patients as specified in this Fact Sheet. You may be contacted and asked to provide information to help with the assessment of the use of the product during this emergency.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>This EUA for VEKLURY will end when the Secretary determines that the circumstances justifying the EUA no longer exist or when there is a change in the approval status of the product such that an EUA is no longer needed.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Hypersensitivity reactions, including infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions, have been observed during and following administration of VEKLURY. Signs and symptoms may include hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypoxia, fever, dyspnea, wheezing, angioedema, rash, nausea, diaphoresis, and shivering. Slower infusion rates, with a maximum infusion time of up to 120 minutes, can be considered to potentially prevent these signs and symptoms. Monitor patients under close medical supervision for hypersensitivity reactions during and following administration of VEKLURY. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occur, immediately discontinue administration of VEKLURY and initiate appropriate treatment. The use of VEKLURY is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to VEKLURY or any components of the product

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Transaminase elevations have been observed in healthy volunteers who received 200 mg of VEKLURY followed by 100 mg doses for up to 10 days; the transaminase elevations were mild (Grade 1) to moderate (Grade 2) in severity and resolved upon discontinuation of VEKLURY. Transaminase elevations have also been reported in patients with COVID-19 who received VEKLURY. Because transaminase elevations have been reported as a clinical feature of COVID-19, including in patients receiving placebo in clinical trials of VEKLURY, and the incidence was similar in patients receiving placebo versus VEKLURY in clinical trials of VEKLURY, discerning the contribution of VEKLURY to transaminase elevations in patients with COVID-19 can be challenging.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Perform hepatic laboratory testing in all patients before starting VEKLURY and while receiving VEKLURY as clinically appropriate.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>NIAID ACTT-1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in hospitalized adult subjects with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 treated with VEKLURY (n=532) or placebo (n=516) for up to 10 days. Subjects treated with VEKLURY received 200 mg on Day 1 and 100 mg once daily on subsequent days. The collection of adverse event data in this trial was limited to severe (Grade 3) or potentially life-threatening (Grade 4) adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation, and moderate (Grade 2) severity or higher hypersensitivity reactions. Rates of adverse reactions (â¥ Grade 3), serious adverse reactions, and adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation are presented in Table 5.</paragraph>

In animal studies, remdesivir and metabolites have been detected in the nursing pups of mothers given remdesivir, likely due to the presence of remdesivir in milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for VEKLURY and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from VEKLURY or from the underlying maternal condition. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID-19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Remdesivir is an inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is essential for viral replication. Remdesivir is an adenosine nucleotide prodrug that distributes into cells where it is metabolized to a nucleoside monophosphate intermediate by carboxyesterase 1 and/or cathepsin A, depending upon the cell type. The nucleoside monophosphate is subsequently phosphorylated by cellular kinases to form the pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate metabolite (GS-443902). Remdesivir triphosphate (RDV TP) acts as an analog of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and competes with high selectivity (3.65-fold) over the natural ATP substrate for incorporation into nascent RNA chains by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which results in delayed chain termination (position i+3) during replication of the viral RNA. In a biochemical assay assessing RDV-TP incorporation by the MERS-CoV RdRp complex, RDV-TP inhibited RNA synthesis with an IC
         
 
  <sub>50</sub> value of 0.032 ÂµM. RDV-TP can also inhibit viral RNA synthesis following its incorporation into the template viral RNA as a result of read-through by the viral polymerase that may occur at higher nucleotide concentrations. When remdesivir nucleotide is present in the viral RNA template, the efficiency of incorporation of the complementary natural nucleotide is compromised, thereby inhibiting viral RNA synthesis. Remdesivir triphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA and RNA polymerases, including human mitochondrial RNA polymerase.

                        <paragraph>Remdesivir exhibited cell culture antiviral activity against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 in primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cells with a 50% effective concentration (EC
         
 
  <sub>50</sub>) of 9.9 nM after 48 hours of treatment. Remdesivir inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the continuous human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3 with an EC
         
 
  <sub>50</sub> value of 280 nM after 72 hours of treatment. The antiviral activity of remdesivir was antagonized by chloroquine phosphate in a dose-dependent manner when the two drugs were co-incubated at clinically relevant concentrations in HEp-2 cells infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Higher remdesivir EC
         
 
  <sub>50</sub> values were observed with increasing concentrations of chloroquine phosphate. Increasing concentrations of chloroquine phosphate reduced formation of remdesivir triphosphate in normal human bronchial epithelial cells.

                        <paragraph>Cell culture resistance profiling of remdesivir using the rodent CoV murine hepatitis virus identified two substitutions (F476L and V553L) in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase at residues conserved across CoVs. The combination of these two substitutions conferred a 5.6-fold reduction in susceptibility to remdesivir. The mutant viruses showed reduced viral fitness in cell culture, and introduction of the corresponding substitutions (F480L and V557L) into SARS-CoV resulted in 6-fold reduction in susceptibility to remdesivir in cell culture and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (ACTT-1, NCT04280705) of hospitalized adult subjects with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 compared treatment with VEKLURY for 10 days (n=541) with placebo (n=521). Mild/moderate disease was defined as SpO
         
 
  <sub>2</sub> &gt;94% and respiratory rate &lt;24 breaths/minute without supplemental oxygen; severe disease was defined as an SpO
         
 
  <sub>2</sub> â¤94% on room air, a respiratory rate â¥24 breaths/minute, an oxygen requirement, or a requirement for mechanical ventilation. Subjects had to have at least one of the following to be enrolled in the trial: radiographic infiltrates by imaging, SpO
         
 
  <sub>2</sub> â¤94% on room air, a requirement for supplemental oxygen, or a requirement for mechanical ventilation. Subjects treated with VEKLURY received 200 mg on Day 1 and 100 mg once daily on subsequent days, for 10 days of treatment via intravenous infusion. Treatment with VEKLURY was stopped in subjects who were discharged from the hospital prior to the completion of 10 days of treatment.
        

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At baseline, mean age was 59 years (with 36% of subjects aged 65 or older); 64% of subjects were male, 53% were White, 21% were Black, and 13% were Asian; 24% were Hispanic or Latino; 105 subjects had mild/moderate disease (10% in both treatment groups); 957 subjects had severe disease (90% in both treatment groups). A total of 285 subjects (27%) (n=131 received VEKLURY) were on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (51%), obesity (45%), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (31%); the distribution of comorbidities was similar between the two treatment groups.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary clinical endpoint was time to recovery within 29 days after randomization. Recovery was defined as discharged from the hospital without limitations on activities, discharged from the hospital with limitations on activities and/or requiring home oxygen, or hospitalized but not requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring ongoing medical care. The median time to recovery was 10 days in the VEKLURY group compared to 15 days in the placebo group (recovery rate ratio 1.29 [95% CI 1.12 to 1.49], p&lt;0.001). Among subjects with mild/moderate disease at enrollment (n=105), the median time to recovery was 5 days in both the VEKLURY and placebo groups (recovery rate ratio 1.22 [95% CI 0.82 to 1.81]). Among subjects with severe disease at enrollment (n=957), the median time to recovery was 11 days in the VEKLURY group compared to 18 days in the placebo group (recovery rate ratio 1.31 [95% CI 1.12 to 1.52]).</paragraph>

It is not known if VEKLURY is safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized children weighing 8 pounds (3.5 kg) to less than 88 pounds (40 kg) or hospitalized children less than 12 years of age weighing at least 8 pounds (3.5 kg), and VEKLURY is not FDA approved for this use. This Fact Sheet contains information to help you understand the potential risks and potential benefits of your child receiving VEKLURY.
      

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Read this Fact Sheet for information about VEKLURY. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have questions.  It is your choice for your child to receive VEKLURY or to stop it at any time.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. People can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, serious illness can happen and may cause some of a child's other medical conditions to become worse. People of all ages with severe, long-lasting (chronic) medical conditions like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Serious illness including breathing problems can occur and may cause your child's other medical conditions to become worse.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>VEKLURY is an approved antiviral medicine for adults and children 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 88 pounds (40 kg) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. VEKLURY was shown in clinical trials in adults to shorten the time to recovery in some people. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>VEKLURY is still being studied in hospitalized children. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There are no medicines approved by the FDA as safe and effective to treat hospitalized children weighing 8 pounds (3.5 kg) to less than 88 pounds (40 kg) or hospitalized children younger than 12 years of age weighing at least 8 pounds (3.5 kg) who have COVID-19. Therefore, the FDA has authorized the emergency use of VEKLURY for this use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). For more information on EUA, see the "

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The United States FDA has made VEKLURY available to hospitalized children weighing 8 pounds (3.5 kg) to less than 88 pounds (40 kg) or hospitalized children less than 12 years of age weighing at least 8 pounds (3.5 kg) under an emergency access mechanism called an EUA. The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that it is reasonable to believe that the product meets certain criteria for safety, performance, and labeling and may be effective in treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used in the treatment of hospitalized children weighing 8 pounds (3.5 kg) to less than 88 pounds (40 kg) or hospitalized children less than 12 years of age weighing at least 8 pounds (3.5 kg) during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks for such use. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The EUA for VEKLURY is in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 declaration justifying emergency use of the product, unless terminated or revoked (after which the product may no longer be used).</paragraph>
